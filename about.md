I am Esteban Sancho, a software geek born in Argentina but now based on Washington DC. 

I work for [Globant][globant] as Technical Director and Technology Evangelist, where I get the chance to work with
large distributed agile teams for cool (and demanding) clients.

Some of my favorite discussion topics are software craftsmanship, functional programming, continuous delivery, content management and agile at scale.

I also like cycling, watchmaking, wrenching bikes and cars, and playing pool.
